  "Even though I'm not there in person, I want you to know that you mean everything to me. I love you way more than anything. Before we were together, I didn't know that I could EVER love anyone or anything as much as I love you, Reagan. I don't know what I'd do without you, babe 🥹 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘💜💜💜💜💜💜",
  "I really love you SOOOOO much, nothing will ever change that, Reagan.",
  "I never could have guessed that you would be the one that I would choose to be with forever just a few months ago. Sure, I wanted to be with you, but I NEVER could have guessed that I could love you THIS MUCH 🥹 🥹 🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘😘",
  "Reagan, even though I'm not with you right now or probably not able to text you right now, I want you to know that I could never have imagined how much I could love my life without you. You've really made me so much happier than I've ever been before, and there's nothing I could ever say or do to really express how much you mean to me, babe 🥹 🥹 🥹 🥹 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜",
  "I really can't believe that I'm saying this, even though I'm just typing this on my computer—not even telling you directly (yet). But I really do think that in 6 years (maybe sooner, we'll see 😏), I could hold your hands, look you in your eyes, and say 'I do'—then kiss you in front of everybody we know. And I'll have you by my side forever. I CANNOT WAIT for that day. I want to spend every waking second with you, and I want to go to sleep holding you in my arms and wake up every morning, looking at your gorgeous face knowing that I finally have everything I've ever wanted in life. I love you babe, I'll tell you all of this in person in a few years 🥹 🥹 🥹 🥹 🥹 🥹 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜"
